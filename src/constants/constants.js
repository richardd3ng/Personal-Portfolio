    title: "Image Reconstruction",
    description: (
      <>
        This project explores the process of recovering digital images that
        contain corrupted pixels using statistical learning approaches such as
        regression and regularization. The general procedure involved dividing
        the corrupted image into blocks, reconstructing each individual block,
        and concatenating all reconstructed blocks into a full image. The
        reconstruction algorithm revolves around fitting a Lasso-regularized
        model with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis vectors as features. To
        learn more, my full presentation slidedoc is linked below in "More
        Info."

    title: "Brain Computer Interface Movement Decoding",
    description: (
      <>
        This project explores the applications of Support Vector Machines to
        distinguish between left and right-handed movement using brain surface
        electrode signals as features. Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI's) are a
        relatively new technology that presents significant potential to help
        individuals with nerve damage who lose the ability to perform normal
        motor functions. If neural signals can be accurately translated into
        real movement intents, BCI's can enable individuals to perform physical
        movements by simply imagining them. To learn more, my full presentation
        slidedoc is linked below in "More Info."

    title: "MusicMap",
    description: (
      <>
        MusicMap, a class project I worked on in a team of 6, is a mobile app
        that documents the songs played during road trips. The app allows users
        to revisit a catalog of all the songs played during the trip and see the
        specific locations associated with each song. A map screen displays the
        userâ€™s current location and drops pins during song changes or image
        uploads. Users can also relive their memories by viewing video collages
        of their songs and images during past trips. I primarily worked on
        implementing the map screen visuals and functionality, which involved
        building various UI components and performing API calls to retrieve
        location data and detect Spotify song changes.

  <>
    Hi there! I'm a Senior at Duke University studying Computer Science and
    Electrical/Computer Engineering . Although I've spent the last few years in
    North Carolina, I originally grew up in the Bay Area, where my interest in
    technology was sparked from an early age. Through my classes and
    extracurriculars, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting
    projects, from developing mobile applications to applying novel ML solutions
    to ongoing problems. I've also gained valuable experience through
    internships at variety of tech companies, where I've had the chance to
    collaborate with talented engineers and learn about the latest industry
    trends and practices. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me working
    out, playing spikeball with friends, experimenting with healthy recipes in
    the kitchen, or traveling to explore new places!
