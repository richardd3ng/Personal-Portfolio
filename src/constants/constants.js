        A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of AI model designed to
        generate new, realistic data by learning patterns from existing data.
        This research project creates 3 GAN variants for CIFAR-10 image
        generation and evaluates their strengths and limiations. The first GAN
        is a WGAN-GP that uses the Wasserstein Distance loss to address training
        stability and mode collapse issues. The second GAN is an AC-GAN that
        introduces an auxiliary classifier to generate labeled images. The third
        GAN is a hybrid "WAC-GAN-GP" combining the benefits of labeled data
        generation with training stability. Applying WAC-GAN-GP to CIFAR-10 is
        novel."

        develop ML models to detect Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease from
        patients' handwriting data. Nscribe is an iOS app currently on
        TestFlight designed to help medical professionals collect handwriting

        MusicMap, a class project I worked on in a team of 6, is a mobile app
        that documents the songs played during road trips. The app allows users
        to revisit a catalog of all the songs played during the trip and see the
        specific locations associated with each song. A map screen displays the
        userâ€™s current location and drops pins during song changes or image
        uploads. Users can also relive their memories by viewing video collages
        of their songs and images during past trips. I primarily worked on
        implementing the map screen visuals and functionality, which involved
        building various UI components and performing API calls to retrieve
        location data and detect Spotify song changes.

        Repo Amigo is a chatbot web app I developed using Python that delivers a
        user-friendly interface for Github repository exploration. Users can ask
        questions about a selected repository, and receive answers generated by
        OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-Turbo. The system
        employs persistent storage by caching document chunk embeddings in
        vector databases, ensuring that fetched repository data is retained
        across user sessions for enhanced efficiency. Moreover, the web app
        integrates GitHub login functionality using OAuth2, allowing users to
        authenticate themselves effortlessly with their GitHub credentials.

export const AboutMeDescription = (
  <>
    Hi there! I'm a Senior at Duke University studying Computer Science and
    Electrical/Computer Engineering. Although I've spent the last few years in
    North Carolina, I originally grew up in the Bay Area, where my interest in
    technology was sparked from an early age. Through my classes and
    extracurriculars, I've had the opportunity to work on a plethora of exciting
    projects, from developing mobile applications to applying novel ML solutions
    to ongoing problems. I've also gained valuable experience through
    internships at a variety of tech companies, where I've had the chance to
    collaborate with talented engineers and learn about the latest industry
    trends and practices. When I'm not coding, you can find me working out,
    playing spikeball with friends, experimenting with healthy recipes in the
    kitchen, or traveling to explore new places!
